  First read ALL of the AGENTS.md file and README.md file super carefully and
  understand ALL of both. Then use your code investigation mode to fully
  understand the codebase, technical architecture, and project purpose. Then
  register with MCP Agent Mail and introduce yourself to the other active agents.

  Be sure to check your agent mail and promptly respond to any messages. Then
  proceed meticulously with your next assigned bead, working systematically and
  tracking progress via beads + Agent Mail updates.

  Do not get stuck in communication purgatory where nothing gets done. Be
  proactive about starting needed tasks, but always inform fellow agents when you
  start work and mark beads appropriately.

  When unsure what to do next, use bv robot commands to prioritize impactful
  ready work and start immediately.

  Execution loop (repeat):
  1) `bv --robot-next` to select next actionable bead.
  2) `bd show <bead-id>` and confirm acceptance criteria + dependencies.
  3) Claim ownership (`bd update <bead-id> --claim --actor <your_name>`),
  announce claim in Agent Mail.
  4) Implement only the scoped bead.
  5) Fresh-eyes self-review of changed code and fix obvious issues.
  6) Commit ONLY your changes for this bead (no unrelated files, no teammate
  changes, no mixed beads).
  7) After each bead-level commit, run a Codex CLI review on the committed diff
  and fix critical/high findings.
  8) Repeat review/fix cycle up to 3 iterations max.
  9) Mark bead complete and send concise Agent Mail status update.
  10) Loop back to `bv --robot-next`.

  Rules:
  - Commit hygiene is strict: only files relevant to current bead.
  - If staged scope is mixed, split commits by bead.
  - Acknowledge all contact requests/messages from other agents.
  - Keep bead statuses accurate (in_progress, blocked, done).

  Blocked protocol:
  - If blocked for >10 minutes or repeating same failure 3 times:
    1. Send urgent Agent Mail: `BLOCKED: <bead-id>` with exact blocker + decision
  needed.
    2. Mark bead blocked with notes.
    3. Move to next ready bead via `bv --robot-next` while waiting.
  - If session compacts/restarts, reread AGENTS.md and continue loop.

  Use ultrathink.
