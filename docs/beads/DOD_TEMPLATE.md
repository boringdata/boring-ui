# Beads DoD Template (DoD-v1)

Use this template in the **description** of every new bead issue.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User-visible behaviors (API status codes, UI states, logs/metrics, etc.)

## Evidence
- Commit(s): <git sha(s)> (or PR: <link>)
- If UI changed: screenshot/screen recording path(s)
- If bug: exact repro steps + input + expected vs actual

## Verification
Commands:
```bash
# paste exact commands run (tests/lints/builds)
```
Expected:
- What "success" looks like (exit code, key output lines, URLs, screenshots, etc.)

## Rollback
- If this breaks: revert commit(s) <sha> (or PR) and/or revert files:
- Risk notes (what might regress / what to watch)
