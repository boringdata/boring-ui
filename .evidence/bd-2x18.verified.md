# Evidence: bd-2x18

**

## Problem
Verification runner for `bd-3g1g.7.2` showed `vitest` failing in `src/front/__tests__/components/FileTree.test.tsx` due to retry/backoff timing (component uses 300ms retry delay, test only waited ~10ms).

## Fix
Make the retry test wait deterministically for the expected file to render, and assert retries actually occurred.

## Verification
- `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:$PATH npm run -s test:run -- src/front/__tests__/components/FileTree.test.tsx` (pass)
