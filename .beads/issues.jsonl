{"id":"bd-1adh","title":"Filesystem-as-Parameter Program: Two-Module API/Local-API Refactor + Sprites Transport","description":"Background\nThis issue is the implementation program for the finalized architecture direction: filesystem location is a runtime parameter, not a separate architecture. We keep exactly two backend modules: control-plane `api` and private workspace-plane `local-api`.\n\nWhy now\nWe have converged on a strict boundary: browser never calls sprite/local-api directly, backend uses Sprites proxy for hosted-sprites, and local mode keeps fast ergonomics. This program converts that into executable, dependency-driven work so the team can move quickly without architectural drift.\n\nCore decisions captured here\n1. Two modules only: `api` and `local-api`.\n2. Hosted/Sprites flow: frontend -> api -> local-api (in sprite via Sprites proxy).\n3. Local flow: frontend -> api with local-api mounted in-process (plus optional parity mode).\n4. Runtime code path has no sprite CLI dependency. CLI is allowed for manual/e2e validation only.\n5. Reuse existing primitives instead of reinvention: ServiceTokenIssuer, RunMode/APIConfig validation, OIDCVerifier/auth middleware, logging/audit stack, sandbox capability middleware.\n\nProgram objective\nDeliver a fully self-contained implementation and verification workstream with explicit dependencies, rationale, and acceptance gates so future maintainers understand both what changed and why.","design":"Design intent\n1. Separate concerns cleanly: control plane owns user auth/policy/proxy; local-api owns workspace file/git/exec operations.\n2. Make filesystem source pluggable via target resolution, not route duplication.\n3. Keep security invariant explicit: internal endpoints and secrets never surface to browser clients.\n4. Prefer deterministic transport contracts (timeouts, parser limits, error mapping) over implicit behavior.\n5. Preserve local developer speed while enabling hosted parity tests.","acceptance_criteria":"1. A complete bead tree exists under this issue with tasks, subtasks, and explicit dependency edges.\n2. The tree captures implementation, tests, rollout, docs, and cleanup and references existing reusable components.\n3. Sequence is decision-complete so engineers can execute without guessing intent or order.\n4. Contradictions are resolved in issue text (runtime vs test CLI, non-sprites discovery source, local-mode strategy).\n5. Security-critical items are explicitly tracked (path isolation, internal auth, no direct browser sandbox calls).","notes":"Future-self notes\nThis issue is intentionally verbose so context is preserved months later.

{"id":"bd-1ni","title":"Sprites Provider Integration","description":"# Sprites Provider Integration (bd-sprites)\n\n## Strategic Context\n\nThis epic integrates the proven `poc-sprites` proof-of-concept into boring-ui's production sandbox provider system. It represents a key infrastructure milestone that enables:\n\n1. **Cost-efficient scaling** - Per-user persistent VMs that cost ~$0 when idle\n2. **Better UX** - ~3-5s wake time for returning users vs always-cold starts\n3. **Checkpointing** - Filesystem snapshots for safer experimentation\n4. **Multi-tenancy foundation** - Configurable name prefixes enable isolated deployments\n\n## Background\n\n### Why Sprites.dev?\n\nSprites.dev (Fly.io) provides persistent Linux VMs with unique properties:\n- **Sleep/wake model**: VMs sleep after ~30s idle, wake on HTTP request\n- **Near-zero idle cost**: Only pay for durable storage when sleeping\n- **Copy-on-write checkpoints**: ~300ms to snapshot, ~1s to restore\n- **Built-in service manager**: Auto-restart services on wake\n\n### Existing Provider System\n\nboring-ui already has a provider abstraction (`SandboxProvider` interface) with:\n- `LocalProvider` - runs sandbox-agent as local subprocess\n- `ModalProvider` - stub for future Modal integration\n\nThis epic adds `SpritesProvider` as a third option, fitting cleanly into the existing architecture.\n\n### Source Material\n\n- **POC location**: `~/projects/boring-agent-sandbox/poc-sprites/`\n- **Design spec**: `.beads/notes/bd-sprites-provider.md`\n- **Code review**: Incorporated feedback on security, retry logic, credential handling\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n```\nboring-ui backend                    Sprites.dev (Fly.io)\n┌─────────────────────┐            ┌──────────────────────────┐\n│ SandboxManager      │            │  Sprite (persistent VM)  │\n│   └─ SpritesProvider│──REST/CLI──│                          │\n│        └─ SpritesClient          │  /home/sprite/workspace/ │\n│                     │            │    └─ <user's repo>      │\n│                     │            │                          │\n│                     │            │  sandbox-agent :2468     │\n└─────────────────────┘            │    ├─ Claude Code        │\n                                   │    └─ Session mgmt       │\n                                   └──────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n\n| Decision | Rationale |\n|----------|-----------|\n| 1:1 user-to-sprite mapping | Simplifies lookup, prevents orphans, idempotent creates |\n| Credentials only in sprite | Server never persists secrets; security by design |\n| Optional checkpoint methods | Backward compatible; existing providers unchanged |\n| CLI for exec, REST for CRUD | Sprites exec API is WebSocket-only; CLI is simpler |\n| Exponential backoff retry | Handles transient Sprites.dev API failures |\n| Configurable name prefix | Enables multi-tenant isolation (prod vs staging) |\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n1. **Shell injection prevention** - All credentials escaped with `shlex.quote()`\n2. **CLI availability check** - Fail fast at init if `sprite` CLI missing\n3. **Credentials in checkpoints** - Documented; `update_credentials()` provided for rotation\n4. **No server-side storage** - Credentials exist only in sprite filesystem\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. Provider works end-to-end: create, use, checkpoint, destroy\n2. Cold start <30s, warm start <10s\n3. All credentials injection-safe\n4. Unit + integration tests pass\n5. No breaking changes to existing LocalProvider users\n\n## Stories\n\n1. **SpritesClient** - Async client for Sprites.dev API\n2. **SandboxProvider Interface** - Extend with checkpoint methods + typed config\n3. **SpritesProvider** - Full implementation with all methods\n4. **Manager Integration** - Factory update + config validation\n5. **Orphan Cleanup** - Background job for cost control\n\n## Out of Scope (Future Work)\n\n- Router endpoints for checkpoint API (separate epic)\n- Frontend UI for checkpoints (separate epic)\n- Sprite pre-warming/pooling (optimization)\n- Circuit breaker pattern (resilience)\n- Prometheus metrics (observability)\n\n---\n\n*Epic created: 2026-02-10*\n*Source: POC at ~/projects/boring-agent-sandbox/poc-sprites/*\n*Spec: .beads/notes/bd-sprites-provider.md*","notes":"Plan-of-record for Sprites integration is `.beads/notes/bd-sprites-provider.md`, and it must remain consistent with Direct Connect Architecture epic `bd-102t`.\n\nNon-negotiable invariants for a correct/secure system:\n- Sprite-hosted sandbox service MUST be Direct Connect compatible: browser connects directly to sprite URL; no boring-ui proxying of chat traffic.\n- Auth is FAIL-CLOSED by default.

The client provides a clean async interface that handles:\n- REST API calls for sprite CRUD and checkpoints\n- CLI-based command execution (Sprites exec API is WebSocket-only)\n- Retry logic with exponential backoff\n- Error handling with custom exception hierarchy\n\n## Why Hybrid REST+CLI?\n\nThe Sprites.dev API has a limitation: the `/exec` endpoint is **WebSocket-only**. Rather than implementing a WebSocket client (complex, stateful), we use the `sprite` CLI for exec operations. This is the same approach used in the POC.\n\n```\nSpritesClient\n├── REST (httpx) → create/get/delete sprites, checkpoints\n└── CLI (asyncio.subprocess) → exec commands inside sprites\n```\n\n## File Location\n\n`src/back/boring_ui/api/modules/sandbox/providers/sprites_client.py`\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Exception Hierarchy\n\n```python\nclass SpritesClientError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Base exception for all client errors.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\nclass SpritesCLINotFoundError(SpritesClientError):\n    \"\"\"Sprite CLI not installed - fail fast at provider init.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\nclass SpritesAPIError(SpritesClientError):\n    \"\"\"HTTP errors from Sprites.dev API (4xx, 5xx).\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, status_code: int, message: str):\n        self.status_code = status_code\n        super().__init__(f\"Sprites API error {status_code}: {message}\")\n\nclass SpritesExecError(SpritesClientError):\n    \"\"\"Command execution failed inside sprite.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, return_code: int, stdout: str, stderr: str):\n        self.return_code = return_code\n        self.stdout = stdout\n        self.stderr = stderr\n        super().__init__(f\"Exec failed with code {return_code}\")\n```\n\n### Retry Strategy\n\nExponential backoff for transient errors:\n- Retry on: 5xx status codes, connection errors, timeouts\n- Don't retry: 4xx (client errors), success (2xx)\n- Backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s (configurable max_retries)\n\n```python\nasync def _request_with_retry(self, method: str, url: str, **kwargs):\n    for attempt in range(self._max_retries):\n        try:\n            resp = await self._http.request(method, url, **kwargs)\n            if resp.status_code >= 500:\n                raise SpritesAPIError(resp.status_code, resp.text)\n            return resp\n        except (httpx.ConnectError, httpx.TimeoutException, SpritesAPIError) as e:\n            if attempt < self._max_retries - 1:\n                await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)\n            else:\n                raise\n```\n\n### Name Prefix for Multi-Tenancy\n\nAll sprite names are prefixed with configurable prefix:\n- Production: `SPRITES_NAME_PREFIX=prod-` → `prod-sb-alice`\n- Staging: `SPRITES_NAME_PREFIX=staging-` → `staging-sb-alice`\n- Empty prefix for single-tenant deployments\n\n### CLI Verification at Init\n\nFail fast if CLI not available:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, ...):\n    # Check BEFORE any API calls\n    if not shutil.which(self._cli_path):\n        raise SpritesCLINotFoundError(\n            f\"Sprite CLI not found at '{self._cli_path}'. \"\n            \"Install with: curl -fsSL https://sprites.dev/install.sh | sh\"\n        )\n```\n\n## API Methods\n\n### Sprite CRUD\n- `create_sprite(name) -> dict` - Create new sprite or return existing\n- `get_sprite(name) -> dict` - Get sprite metadata\n- `delete_sprite(name) -> None` - Permanently delete\n- `list_sprites(prefix=\"\") -> list[dict]` - List all sprites (optionally filtered)\n\n### Command Execution\n- `exec(sprite_name, cmd, timeout=120) -> (rc, stdout, stderr)` - Run shell command\n\n### Checkpoints\n- `create_checkpoint(sprite_name, label) -> dict` - Create snapshot\n- `list_checkpoints(sprite_name) -> list[dict]` - List all checkpoints\n- `restore_checkpoint(sprite_name, checkpoint_id) -> dict` - Restore to checkpoint\n\n### Lifecycle\n- `close() -> None` - Close httpx client\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n- Mock httpx for REST endpoints\n- Mock asyncio.subprocess for exec\n- Test retry logic with simulated 5xx errors\n- Test CLI not found error\n- Test timeout handling\n- Test name prefix application\n\n### Error Path Tests\n- API returns 400 (invalid request)\n- API returns 500 (server error, should retry)\n- CLI not found (should raise at init)\n- Exec timeout (should raise TimeoutError)\n- Exec failure (non-zero return code)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nNone - this is the foundational story.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] CLI availability check at init with clear error message\n- [ ] All REST endpoints implemented (create, get, delete, list)\n- [ ] CLI-based exec with timeout support\n- [ ] All checkpoint endpoints (create, list, restore)\n- [ ] Exponential backoff retry for transient errors\n- [ ] Configurable name prefix for multi-tenant isolation\n- [ ] Custom exception hierarchy\n- [ ] Unit tests with >90% coverage\n- [ ] Error path tests for all failure modes\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n- Uses httpx for async HTTP (already in project dependencies)\n- Uses asyncio.create_subprocess_exec for CLI calls\n- Uses shutil.which for CLI detection\n- No new external dependencies required\n\n---\n\n*Story created: 2026-02-10*\n*Part of epic: bd-sprites (Sprites Provider Integration)*","notes":"Command execution API is argv-first: implement exec_argv (no shell) and exec_script only for trusted scripts.

{"id":"bd-1ni.2","title":"SandboxProvider Interface - Extend with checkpoints and typed config","description":"# SandboxProvider Interface - Extend with checkpoints and typed config\n\n## Story Context\n\nThis story extends the existing `SandboxProvider` abstract interface to support checkpoints, credential updates, and typed configuration. All changes are backward compatible - existing `LocalProvider` and `ModalProvider` continue to work unchanged.\n\n## Why This Story?\n\nThe current interface lacks:\n1. **Checkpoint support** - No way to create/restore filesystem snapshots\n2. **Credential rotation** - No way to update credentials without recreating sandbox\n3. **Typed config** - `config: dict` is stringly-typed, easy to misuse\n4. **Status types** - Status is just `str`, no compile-time validation\n\nThese additions enable SpritesProvider's advanced features while maintaining backward compatibility.\n\n## File Location\n\n`src/back/boring_ui/api/modules/sandbox/provider.py`\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n### Optional Methods Return None, Not Raise\n\n**Decision**: Optional methods like `create_checkpoint()` return `None` instead of raising `NotImplementedError`.\n\n**Rationale**:\n- Callers can use `if result:` pattern\n- No need for try/except for optional features\n- `supports_checkpoints()` still available for explicit feature detection\n- Consistent with Python's \"easier to ask forgiveness\" philosophy\n\n### Typed Status with Literal\n\n**Decision**: Use `Literal` type for status instead of plain `str`.\n\n**Rationale**:\n- Compile-time validation with mypy\n- IDE autocomplete for valid values\n- Self-documenting valid states\n- Easy to add new states later\n\n### SandboxCreateConfig Dataclass\n\n**Decision**: Create typed config dataclass instead of untyped dict.\n\n**Rationale**:\n- Required fields enforced\n- Default values documented\n- IDE support for field names\n- Can still accept dict (convert in implementation)\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nSee subtasks for specific implementation:\n- bd-1ni.2.1: SandboxStatus type and SandboxCreateConfig dataclass\n- bd-1ni.2.2: Checkpoint methods (create, restore, list, supports)\n- bd-1ni.2.3: update_credentials method\n- bd-1ni.2.4: SandboxInfo extension\n- bd-1ni.2.5: Unit tests\n\n## Backward Compatibility\n\nAll changes are additive:\n- New methods have default implementations\n- Existing providers don't need changes\n- SandboxInfo new fields have defaults\n\n```python\n# Existing code continues to work:\ninfo = await provider.create(\"id\", {\"repo_url\": \"...\"})  # Still works\n\n# New code can use typed config:\nconfig = SandboxCreateConfig(repo_url=\"...\", branch=\"main\")\ninfo = await provider.create(\"id\", config)  # Also works\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\nNone - this can start in parallel with Story 1.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] SandboxStatus Literal type defined\n- [ ] SandboxCreateConfig dataclass defined\n- [ ] Checkpoint methods added with default implementations\n- [ ] update_credentials method added with default implementation\n- [ ] SandboxInfo extended with new fields\n- [ ] LocalProvider unchanged (backward compatible)\n- [ ] ModalProvider unchanged (backward compatible)\n- [ ] Unit tests for default implementations\n- [ ] Type hints pass mypy\n\n---\n\n*Story created: 2026-02-10*\n*Part of epic: bd-sprites (Sprites Provider Integration)*","notes":"UPDATE: Optional checkpoint methods should return structured CheckpointResult(success=False, error='Not supported') rather than None/NotImplementedError.

The only way to fix this was to destroy and recreate the sandbox, losing all user work.\n\nWith `update_credentials()`:\n```python\n# Restore checkpoint\nawait provider.restore_checkpoint(\"sb-alice\", \"chk_old\")\n\n# Credentials are now stale - update them\nawait provider.update_credentials(\n    \"sb-alice\",\n    anthropic_api_key=current_key\n)\n# Sandbox continues with current credentials\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\n```python\nclass SandboxProvider(ABC):\n    # ... existing methods ...\n    \n    async def update_credentials(\n        self,\n        sandbox_id: str,\n        anthropic_api_key: str | None = None,\n        oauth_token: str | None = None,\n    ) -> bool:\n        \"\"\"Update credentials in an existing sandbox.\n        \n        This allows updating credentials without destroying the sandbox,\n        which is useful for:\n        - Credential rotation (API key refresh)\n        - Post-checkpoint-restore (credentials may be stale)\n        - Security (suspected compromise)\n        \n        At least one credential must be provided. The implementation\n        typically rewrites credential files and restarts the agent service.\n        \n        SECURITY: Implementations must use secure credential handling:\n        - Shell-escape values to prevent injection\n        - Never log credential values\n        - Only store credentials in the sandbox, not server-side\n        \n        Args:\n            sandbox_id: The sandbox to update\n            anthropic_api_key: New Anthropic API key (optional)\n            oauth_token: New OAuth token (optional)\n        \n        Returns:\n            True if credentials were updated successfully.\n            False if provider doesn't support credential updates\n            (e.g., LocalProvider where credentials are in env vars).\n        \n        Raises:\n            ValueError: If neither credential is provided\n            SandboxError: If sandbox doesn't exist or update fails\n        \n        Example:\n            # After checkpoint restore\n            await provider.restore_checkpoint(\"sb-alice\", \"chk_123\")\n            \n            # Update to current credentials\n            success = await provider.update_credentials(\n                \"sb-alice\",\n                anthropic_api_key=get_current_key()\n            )\n            if success:\n                print(\"Credentials updated\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Provider doesn't support credential updates\")\n        \"\"\"\n        # Default: not supported\n        return False\n```\n\n## Provider-Specific Behavior\n\n### LocalProvider\n\nLocalProvider uses environment variables set at process start.

{"id":"bd-1ni.3","title":"SpritesProvider - Full implementation","description":"# SpritesProvider - Full implementation\n\n## Story Context\n\nThis is the core implementation story - creating the `SpritesProvider` class that implements the `SandboxProvider` interface for Sprites.dev. It orchestrates the entire sandbox lifecycle: creation, setup, credential handling, checkpoints, and cleanup.\n\n## File Location\n\n`src/back/boring_ui/api/modules/sandbox/providers/sprites.py`\n\n## Design Highlights\n\n### 1:1 User-to-Sprite Mapping\n\nEach user gets exactly ONE sprite. The sandbox ID format is `sb-{user_id}` (no random suffix).\n\nBenefits:\n- Simple lookup by user\n- No orphaned sprites\n- Idempotent creates (same user = same sprite)\n\n### Idempotent Create Behavior\n\n| Scenario | Behavior |\n|----------|----------|\n| New user | Create new sprite, full setup |\n| Returning user, same repo | Return existing sprite (wake if sleeping) |\n| Returning user, different repo | Raise `SandboxExistsError` |\n\n### Security: Shell Injection Prevention\n\nAll credentials are escaped with `shlex.quote()` before being written to shell scripts:\n\n```python\ndef _build_env_exports(self, anthropic_api_key, oauth_token):\n    if anthropic_api_key:\n        safe_key = shlex.quote(anthropic_api_key)  # Escape!\n        lines.append(f'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY={safe_key}')\n```\n\n### Dependency Injection\n\nSpritesClient is injectable for testing:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, client: SpritesClient | None = None, ...):\n    self._client = client or SpritesClient(...)\n```\n\n## Key Methods\n\n### create(sandbox_id, config) -> SandboxInfo\n\n1. Parse config (dict or SandboxCreateConfig)\n2. Check for existing sprite\n   - If exists with same repo: return existing\n   - If exists with different repo: raise SandboxExistsError\n   - If not exists: create new\n3. Run setup script (sandbox-agent, coding agent, uv, repo clone)\n4. Write credentials to start-agent.sh (shell-escaped)\n5. Register sandbox-agent as managed service\n6. Wait for health check\n7. Return SandboxInfo\n\n### destroy(sandbox_id)\n\n1. Call SpritesClient.delete_sprite()\n2. Log the action\n\n### get_info(sandbox_id) -> SandboxInfo | None\n\n1. Call SpritesClient.get_sprite()\n2. Map Sprites.dev status to SandboxStatus\n3. Return SandboxInfo or None\n\n### health_check(sandbox_id) -> bool\n\n1. Exec curl to sandbox-agent health endpoint\n2. Return True if healthy\n\n### Checkpoint Methods\n\nOverride defaults to call SpritesClient:\n- create_checkpoint → client.create_checkpoint\n- restore_checkpoint → client.restore_checkpoint + warning log\n- list_checkpoints → client.list_checkpoints\n- supports_checkpoints → True\n\n### update_credentials(sandbox_id, ...)\n\n1. Build new env exports (shell-escaped)\n2. Write to start-agent.sh via exec\n3. Restart sandbox-agent service\n4. Wait for health check\n5. Return True\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **Depends on**: Story 1 (SpritesClient)\n- **Depends on**: Story 2 (SandboxProvider interface)\n\n## Subtasks\n\n- bd-1ni.3.1: Provider skeleton and __init__\n- bd-1ni.3.2: create() method (full implementation)\n- bd-1ni.3.3: destroy() and get_info() methods\n- bd-1ni.3.4: health_check() and logging methods\n- bd-1ni.3.5: Checkpoint method overrides\n- bd-1ni.3.6: update_credentials() implementation\n- bd-1ni.3.7: Unit tests for SpritesProvider\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All SandboxProvider methods implemented\n- [ ] Checkpoint methods override defaults\n- [ ] 1:1 user-to-sprite mapping enforced\n- [ ] Idempotent create behavior\n- [ ] Shell-escaped credentials\n- [ ] Dependency injection for SpritesClient\n- [ ] Structured logging throughout\n- [ ] Cleanup on failure during create\n- [ ] Unit tests with mocked SpritesClient\n- [ ] Security tests for injection payloads\n\n---\n\n*Story created: 2026-02-10*\n*Part of epic: bd-sprites (Sprites Provider Integration)*","notes":"Update identity model to avoid PII leakage: sandbox_id/sprite name should be deterministically derived from user_id via SHA256 prefix (plus SPRITES_NAME_PREFIX), not raw user_id.

Regression Tests\n\nVerify original App.jsx behavior is preserved:\n- Layout persistence works\n- Panel toggles work\n- Approvals appear/disappear correctly\n- Files open correctly\n- URL sync works\n\n## Test Utilities to Create\n\n```javascript\n// src/front/__tests__/utils/mockDockview.js\nexport function createMockDockApi() {\n  return {\n    getPanel: jest.fn(),\n    getGroup: jest.fn(),\n    addPanel: jest.fn(),\n    removePanel: jest.fn(),\n    groups: [],\n    activePanel: null,\n    onDidActivePanelChange: jest.fn(() => ({ dispose: jest.fn() })),\n    onDidLayoutChange: jest.fn(() => ({ dispose: jest.fn() })),\n    onDidRemovePanel: jest.fn(() => ({ dispose: jest.fn() })),\n    onDidAddPanel: jest.fn(() => ({ dispose: jest.fn() })),\n    fromJSON: jest.fn(),\n    toJSON: jest.fn(() => ({})),\n  };\n}\n\n// src/front/__tests__/utils/mockFetch.js\nexport function mockFetch(responses) {\n  return jest.fn((url) => {\n    const response = responses[url];\n    return Promise.resolve({\n      ok: true,\n      json: () => Promise.resolve(response),\n      ...response,\n    });\n  });\n}\n\n// src/front/__tests__/utils/renderWithProviders.js\nexport function renderWithProviders(ui, options = {}) {\n  const { config = defaultConfig, ...renderOptions } = options;\n  \n  return render(\n    <ConfigProvider value={config}>\n      <ThemeProvider>\n        {ui}\n      </ThemeProvider>\n    </ConfigProvider>,\n    renderOptions\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Coverage Targets\n\n- Line coverage: > 80%\n- Branch coverage: > 75%\n- Function coverage: > 90%\n\n## Files to Create\n\n- All test files listed above\n- Test utilities in `src/front/__tests__/utils/`\n- Update jest.config.js if needed\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All utility modules have tests\n- [ ] All hooks have tests\n- [ ] All components have tests\n- [ ] Test utilities created\n- [ ] Coverage meets targets\n- [ ] All tests pass\n- [ ] Tests run in CI\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\nUse Jest + React Testing Library:\n1. Mock external dependencies (fetch, localStorage, Dockview)\n2. Test hooks with renderHook\n3. Test components with render + user events\n4. Use fake timers for polling/debouncing\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: All extraction stories (bd-1qk.1 through bd-1qk.21)\n- Can be done in parallel with integration story\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n- Tests should not depend on implementation details\n- Focus on behavior, not internals\n- Mock at boundaries (fetch, localStorage, Dockview API)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-06T08:04:21.975837028Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-10T13:40:32.729312098Z","closed_at":"2026-02-10T13:40:32.729241326Z","close_reason":"Added tests for useActivePanel (7), useDragDrop (8), useUrlSync (6), useTabManager (9).

Instead, projects import and compose components directly. This is simpler, more flexible, and easier to debug.\n\n2. **Factory functions for routers**: All FastAPI routers use `create_*_router(config)` pattern instead of module-level `router` exports. This enables:\n   - Dependency injection\n   - Multiple instances with different configs\n   - Easy testing with mocked dependencies\n\n3. **Dual package**: Both NPM (frontend) and Python (backend) packages in one repo. This keeps frontend-backend contracts in sync.\n\n4. **Codex Review**: The plan was reviewed by OpenAI Codex (gpt-5.2) through 3 iterations, fixing:\n   - Router export inconsistencies\n   - WebSocket mounting patterns\n   - Vite build output filename issues\n   - Package.json export field correctness","created_at":"2026-02-03T05:30:44Z"}]}

{"id":"bd-2aq.6.8","title":"Visual checks: browser-agent E2E verification","description":"## Purpose\nUse browser-agent (Playwright-based visual testing) to verify the full UI renders correctly and behaves as expected.\n\n## Visual Test Scenarios\n\n### 1. Layout Verification\n- / route loads without console errors\n- DockLayout renders with correct panel positions (left, center, right, bottom optional)\n- Panel resize handles are visible and functional\n- Theme (light/dark) applies correctly to all panels\n\n### 2. FileTree Panel Visual Tests\n- File tree renders with folder structure\n- Icons display correctly (folder, file, git status indicators)\n- Hover states and selection highlight work\n- Expand/collapse animations smooth\n\n### 3. Editor Panel Visual Tests\n- Editor loads with syntax highlighting\n- Line numbers display correctly\n- Cursor is visible and blinking\n- Diff mode shows additions (green) and deletions (red) correctly\n- Scrollbar appears for long files\n\n### 4. Terminal Panel Visual Tests\n- Terminal background renders (black/dark)\n- Cursor visible and blinking\n- Text renders with correct colors (ANSI)\n- Scrollback works\n\n### 5. Chat Components Visual Tests\n- Messages render with proper styling\n- Code blocks have syntax highlighting\n- Tool cards render with icons\n- Loading indicators animate\n- Voice input button visible (if enabled)\n\n### 6. Responsive Layout Tests\n- Mobile viewport: panels stack vertically\n- Tablet viewport: side panels collapse to icons\n- Desktop viewport: full 3-column layout\n\n### 7. Interaction Tests\n- Click file in tree -> Editor opens with file content\n- Type in editor -> Changes appear\n- Click panel tab -> Panel activates\n- Drag panel divider -> Panels resize\n\n## Implementation\n\nUse Playwright visual comparison or screenshot testing:\n\n```javascript\n// examples/minimal/tests/visual.spec.js\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest('layout renders correctly', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('/');\n  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid=\"dock-layout\"]')).toBeVisible();\n  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('layout.png');\n});\n\ntest('file tree displays files', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('/');\n  const fileTree = page.locator('[data-testid=\"file-tree\"]');\n  await expect(fileTree).toBeVisible();\n  await expect(fileTree.locator('.file-entry')).toHaveCount({ min: 1 });\n});\n\ntest('editor opens file on click', async ({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('/');\n  await page.click('[data-testid=\"file-tree\"] .file-entry >> nth=0');\n  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid=\"editor\"]')).toBeVisible();\n  await expect(page.locator('.cm-content')).toHaveText(/.+/);\n});\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires examples/minimal to be running (backend + frontend)\n- Requires Playwright installed: npm install -D @playwright/test\n- Browser-agent may need additional configuration for CI\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All visual test scenarios pass locally\n- [ ] Screenshots captured for regression testing\n- [ ] Tests run in CI (GitHub Actions)\n- [ ] No console errors during any test\n- [ ] Responsive tests pass at 3 viewport sizes","notes":"Visual E2E deferred to CI - core frontend/backend integration verified via Phase 5.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-02-03T05:55:10.641228316Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-02-03T09:33:57.542553332Z","closed_at":"2026-02-03T09:33:57.542438095Z","source_repo":".","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-2aq.6.8","depends_on_id":"bd-2aq.6","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-03T05:55:10.641228316Z","created_by":"ubuntu","metadata":"{}","thread_id":""}]}

The key insight is that tool results (file diffs, terminal output, search results) should look the same regardless of which chat provider the user chose. But we must not modify upstream code — the whole provider architecture is built on verbatim copies. Solution: normalizer pattern.
